# Treasure chest lottery

There are 100 players participating in a treasure chest lottery with strange rules.

The players get numbered from 1 to 100. Every player now also writes their number on a token. The players are later supposed to find their own token.

There is a big room with a long row of 100 treasure chests. The lottery host now collects the tokens, secretly shuffles them and puts one token into each treasure chest.

Now, one by one the players may enter the room, are allowed to open up to 50 treasure chests and should find their own token. They win as a group if every single player finds their token. If a single player doesn't find their token within 50 attempts, everybody loses.

Which strategy do the players have to employ to maximize their chance of winning?

Summary:
- The players are allowed to meet and agree on a strategy before the game starts. This strategy is what I'm asking for as a solution.
- The players will never meet again and will have no means of communication.
- Players can't leave any clues (open chests, sorted tokens, etc.) for subsequent players. The room with the treasure chests will be reset to its initial state between each two players.
