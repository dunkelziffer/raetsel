# Random hats

There are 100 players participating in a game show.

Each player will receive a hat, which they cannot see (or determine by other means). There are 100 possible types of hats. Be aware that each hat type doesn't necessarily appear exactly once. Hat types may appear multiple times or not at all. In the extreme case all 100 players could receive the same type of hat.

Now the players enter a big room where they can see the other's hats. Every player places a bet on the type of their own hat.

The players win as a group when at least one player correctly guesses their own hat.

Which strategy do the players have to employ to always win?

Clarifications:
- The players are allowed to meet and agree on a strategy before the game starts. This strategy is what I'm asking for as a solution.
- The players are not allowed to communicate verbally or by other means, e.g. by walking around the room and thereby sorting themselves.
